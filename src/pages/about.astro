    <p>
      {SITE_TITLE} is a fantasy worldbuilding project involving writing, music composition,
      sound design, cinematography, and 3D modeling and animation. I created it as
      an opportunity to practice and partake in a wide variety of hobbies that I
      enjoy.

      Outside of creative hobbies, I’ve recently (as of late 2024) started
      <a href="/bjj">studying Brazilian jiu-jitsu</a>. It doesn’t really fit in
      with the rest of the content here, but since this is my website, I can add
      anything I want. :)
