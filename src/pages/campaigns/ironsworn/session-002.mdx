## Introduction

<IronswornCharacterSheet {...PlayerCharacter_000} />

## Outline

* Lucia is hunting in the forest when she gets an uneasy feeling that something is wrong.

* As she makes to leave, she’s distracted by SOMETHING, and a young man burst suddenly out of the surrounding forest and runs into her, knocking her over. She gains 10 embarrassment points.
* He’s dressed like a merchant and has a soft and naïve air about him.
* He says that he was traveling across the Havens and sought shelter in the forest but got lost and has been hearing troubling noises in the trees.
* You agree to lead him out of the forest, but as the two of you turn to leave, you hear something approaching.

* A beast bursts out of the trees. Elder Beast (extreme), big bear

* You tell the merchant to run, and he scrambles away.
* The bear goes after him.
* You yell at the bear to get its attention.

* The bear turns around and charges you. It’s faster than you expected, and the merchant has fallen and seems to be paralyzed by fear. You’re on your own.

* Your arrow hits the bear in its big bear back. The bear is hurt and confused.
* The bear strikes a tree near the fallen merchant, and the impact wakes him.
* You call him towards you, and he crawls away from the bear is it continues to make a big ol’ bear ruckus amongst the trees.
* You recall your father telling you when you were young that it’s dangerous to make too much noise in the forest.
* The merchant reaches the gully(?) that you leapt across, but he’s afraid to jump across.

```

* You try to convince him to leap or die, but his courage fails him.
* The bear catches up and swipes the merchant with its big ol’ bear paw.
* The merchant falls into the gully (what is a gully?).
* You look up and lock eyes with the bear, and you see its pain and rage.
* You realize that this bear is totally gonna jump over this gully and kill you.
* As the bear makes ready to charge, you hear the caw (or whatever sound ravens make) of a raven.
* A cloud of darkness engulfs the bear's head as a metric shit-ton of ravens comes out of nowhere and barrage the elder beast's head.
* You remember your father telling you stories of the ravens of the forest when you were young—something really interesting that adds flavor to the setting. Those birds aren't afraid of shit.
* While the bear is distracted, you look down at the bottom of the gully and see the merchant lying dead-like.
* You debate within yourself whether to run and save yourself, but you ultimately decide that saving the man is the right thing to do.

* You climb slowly down the gully.
* During your descent, you hear the elder bear retreat into the forest, still harangued by the persistent birds.
* You're scratched up and exhausted by the time you reach the bottom, and it's dark and difficult to see.
* You take a torch out of your bag of holding and peer out with your small light.
* You hear the (insert raven sound here) of a raven and turn your torch toward the sound.
* A raven has landed near the merchant's still form.
* You thank the raven and it flies away. This raven will definitely be an animal friend for later.
* You reach the young man. He is grievously wounded from his fall.
* You commit to taking him to his home circle.

```
Oracle: Settlement name
<<30>>
A manmade edifice. What is it? Why is it important to this settlement’s history?
- Surrounded by wooden walls, insular and distrustful of outsiders.
<<57>>
Timberwall
```

* You travel all night and reach the gates of Timberwall by dawn.
* The gatekeeper is suspicious of you, coming as strangers in the dark, but when you show him the merchant's face, he gasps in recognition.
* He calls the young man "Master Pendry" and immediately opens the gate and calls the other guards.
* The guards rush you into the circle, taking you to the, um, city hall-slash-governer's mansion place. 
* Upon reaching the governor's mansion, the lights come on inside the house and a woman runs out of the building, crying out for Pendry. It's his mom.
* Pendry's family and retainers (what's a retainer?) rush him inside to care for him.
* Left alone with the guards, they turn on you.
* They ask you what you've done to the son of (insert important people here).
* You tell them about the elder beast, but they don't believe you.
* They accuse you of harming Pendry and attempting to bring him to Timberwall for ransom.
* Timberwall is an insular community, and they express distrust of you as a stranger who has come in the night.
* They mention murders that have happened recently that rumor says was committed by horrors but perhaps were committed by someone like you.
* One of the older guards recognizes you as the forebear of the Skulde descendants who were cast out of Timberwall generations ago.
* The older guard tells you that it's there is new, ruthless leadership in Timberwell, and it's a dangerous time for you to have come here.
* Tired and wounded, you ask for a chance to rest.

```

* The older guard takes pity on you and allows you to retire to a small room in SOMEWHERE.
* You, um, consort with yourself by meditating and thinking of the life lessons your parents taught you. It lifts your spirits.

---

* You dream of a city of strong walls. It's a dream you've had before but have never been able to make sense of.
* You wake up in the bare room you retired to this morning. It's evening now, and the guards have come for you.
* They take you back to the governor's mansion where you meet the new leaders of Timberwall. There are several of them, each with a different personality.
* NO - They tell you that you'll be standing trial for the recent murders tonight.
* NO - You protest that it's outrageous that a trial would take place with so little warning.
* NO - One of the leaders—a brash and ruthless one—tells you that we need to keep the narrative moving—just kidding—he says that the people want order preserved and justice to be served as quickly as possible, and that's what his family has promised to do.
* NO - Your trial starts tonight.
* They accuse you of the murders based on your family's Skulde heritage.
* The leaders demean you and your family name and demand that you swear on iron that your family, uh, sucks and that you committed the murders.
* This use of iron is a bastardization of the traditional use of iron as a noble means of swearing vows, which your family always respected despite being Skulde.
* Incensed, you instead take iron they offer you and swear that you will clear your family's name.

* The leaders acquiesce to your request for a trial, but they forbid you from walking around the circle with no one to vouch for you.
* The guards take you to a jail cell.

---

* Sitting in your jail cell, you think about what you need to do.
* First, you need to get out of this cell.
* You remember that you do have one friend in Timberwall.
* Your only guard is a young man who doesn't seem particularly vindictive.
