## Introduction

This is a solo playthrough of the <ExternalLink href="https://tomkinpress.com/pages/ironsworn">_Ironsworn_</ExternalLink>
tabletop roleplaying game by Shawn Tomkin,
and I’m playing using a variant I made up that I call “Achievements Mode.”

The name is inspired by the concept of video game achievements,
which are made-up rewards for accomplishing arbitrary tasks inside a video game.
Some people find chasing video game achievements to be pointless, but for the most part, I think that collecting them is a fun challenge.

In the Achievements Mode variant, I’ll attempt to incorporate into my RPG narrative __every__ Quest Starter prompt
in the _Ironsworn_ rulebook associated with my world’s truths and my chosen setting.
In total, that’s 12 prompts. I’m not required to adhere to the exact text of the prompts,
but I want each prompt to be a significant source of inspiration for some part of my narrative.

I may very well end up creating an overcomplicated mess,
but I relish the challenge of trying to weave together so many ideas and plotlines into a coherent story.
Growing up, I loved epic fantasy novels like those found in the _A Song of Ice and Fire_ and _The Wheel of Time_ series,
and my taste for complex narratives and sprawling cast lists has remained until now.

Oh, and I’m also going to try to have my player character collect as many animal friends
(sourced from the _Ironsworn_ companion asset cards) as possible.
Just because I really like animals.

## Our Hero

I’m gonna be honest: I don’t feel like writing out a detailed backstory for my player character.
I have some biographical traits in mind for her, but as for sharing them with an audience,
my aim is to present my character’s history and personality organically through the narrative.

For now, I’ll just say that she’s a loner with a lot of __heart__ and decent __edge__ and __wits__ who specializes in __archery__.
She has low __iron__ and __shadow__, so sneaking and brute force aren’t her strengths.

As much as possible, I want to develop the story as I go, so I haven’t chosen any initial background bonds.
I’ll make those up on the fly as good opportunities present themselves.

I want my character to be adept at making animal friends, so I’ve given her the __Animal Kin__ path asset.
I also have some presently vague yet ambitious ideas regarding her background vow, so I’ve given her the __Fated__ path asset.

My character’s background vow is inspired by the Quest Starter prompt for one of my world’s truths (which I’ll go over later):

> You have vivid reoccurring dreams of an Ironlands city.
> It has strong stone walls, bustling markets, and a keep on a high hill.
> ... Nowhere in the Ironlands does such a city exist.
> ... Somehow, no matter how long it takes, you must make this vision a reality.
>
> — <cite>_Ironsworn_</cite> rulebook, p. 125

I want my character’s overarching story to be that of __founding the Ironlands’ first great city__. A tall order, to be sure.

I don’t care too much about how my character looks, so feel free to imagine her appearance however you’d like it to be.

Finally, I’ve named my character __Lucia__. I consulted the __Ironlander Names__ oracle table and rolled an __81__,
which gave me the names Pendry and Shekhar as options. I wasn’t feeling either of those for my player character’s name,
so I mulliganed. My second roll was a __76__, which gave me “Kormak” and “Lucia.”
“Lucia” sounded good to me, so that is what my character’s name shall be.

## Our Setting

I chose the __Havens__ as the primary setting of my story
because its Quest Starter interested me more than those of the other Ironland regions.
The notion of a community being subject to unjust and cruel leadership seems like
it could offer opportunities for compelling political and interpersonal intrigues.

<aside class="paragraphs-container">
  ### The Havens

  An expansive region of forests, rivers, shrubland, and low hills.

  <details>
    <summary>Quest Starter</summary>

    <div>
      A settlement has fallen under the unjust rule of a cruel leader.
      What leverage do they hold over these people?
      ... What can be done to overthrow this tyrant?
    </div>

## Our Truths

These are the truths I’ve chosen for my world (truncated so that I don’t copy an egregious amount of the _Ironsworn_ rulebook text).

I don’t want magic to play a large role in the story, at least initially.
Magic might end up being a background element that incrementally comes to the fore as the story progresses.
Similarly, I’m starting with the premise that beasts and horrors are only the stuff of legends,
but that assumption might be refuted later.

I won’t go into further detail on my truths, as you can read them yourself below
and I’m itching to just start playing.
Hopefully, I’ll also be able to exposit all these aspects of my world organically through the narrative.

<aside class="paragraphs-container">
  ### The Old World

  The savage clans called the Skulde invaded the kingdoms of the Old World.
  ... After an arduous months-long voyage, the survivors made landfall upon the Ironlands.

  <details>
    <summary>Quest Starter</summary>

    <div>
      You are a descendant of the Skulde.
      Because of your heritage, your family has long borne the distrust of your fellow Ironlanders.
      Now, a small force of Skulde have landed on our shores.
      ... Where do your loyalties lie?
    </div>
  </details>

<aside class="paragraphs-container">
  ### Iron

  The weather is bleak. ... The winters are long and bitter.
  One of the first settlers complained, “Only those made of iron dare live in this foul place”—and thus our land was named.

  <details>
    <summary>Quest Starter</summary>

    <div>
      The harvest fell short. The unrelenting snows left the village isolated. ...
      What will you do to see these people through this harsh season?
    </div>
  </details>
</aside>

<aside class="paragraphs-container">
  ### Legacies

  Other humans sailed here from the Old World untold years ago, but all
  that is left of them is a savage, feral people we call the broken.

   <details>
    <summary>Quest Starter</summary>

    <div>
      You find a child—one of the broken.
      It is wounded, and hunted by others of its kind.
      Do you protect it, even at the risk of inviting the wrath of the broken tribes?
    </div>
  </details>
</aside>

<aside class="paragraphs-container">
  ### Communities

  We live in communities called circles. These are settlements ranging in
  size from a steading with a few families to a village of several hundred.
  ... We trade (and sometimes feud) with other circles.

   <details>
    <summary>Quest Starter</summary>

    <div>
      A decades-long feud between two circles has flared into open conflict.
      ... Do you join in the fight, or swear to put a stop to it?
    </div>
  </details>
</aside>

<aside class="paragraphs-container">
  ### Leaders

  Leadership is as varied as the people.
  Some communities are governed by the head of a powerful family.
  Or, they have a council of elders who make decisions and settle disputes.

   <details>
    <summary>Quest Starter</summary>

    <div>
      You have vivid reoccurring dreams of an Ironlands city.
      It has strong stone walls, bustling markets, and a keep on a high hill. ...
      Somehow, no matter how long it takes, you must make this vision a reality.
    </div>
  </details>
</aside>

<aside class="paragraphs-container">
  ### Defense

  The wardens are our soldiers, guards, and militia.
  They serve their communities by standing sentry, patrolling surrounding lands,
  and organizing defenses in times of crisis.

   <details>
    <summary>Quest Starter</summary>

    <div>
      You come upon a dying warden.
      She tells you of an important mission, and charges you with its completion.
      “Swear to me,” she says, reaching out with a bloodied hand to give you an object crucial to the quest.
      What is it?
    </div>
  </details>
</aside>

<aside class="paragraphs-container">
  ### Mysticism

  Magic is rare and dangerous, but those few who wield the power are truly gifted.

   <details>
    <summary>Quest Starter</summary>

    <div>
      You have heard stories of someone who wields true power.
      They live in an isolated settlement far away. ...
      Are they feared or respected? Why do you swear to seek them out?
    </div>
  </details>
</aside>

<aside class="paragraphs-container">
  ### Religion

  A few Ironlanders still make signs or mumble prayers out of habit or tradition,
  but most believe the gods long ago abandoned us.

   <details>
    <summary>Quest Starter</summary>

    <div>
      A charismatic Ironlander, encouraging her followers
      to renounce the vestiges of Old World religions, proposes a new path for this new world.
      ... What does she seek to achieve? Are you sworn to aid or stop her?
    </div>
  </details>
</aside>

<aside class="paragraphs-container">
  ### Firstborn

  The firstborn have passed into legend.
  Some say the remnants of the old tribes still dwell in deep forests or high mountains.

   <details>
    <summary>Quest Starter</summary>

    <div>
      Someone obsessed with the firstborn wants to find evidence of their existence.
      This will require an expedition into the far reaches of the Ironlands.
      What is your role in this mission?
    </div>
  </details>
</aside>

<aside class="paragraphs-container">
  ### Beasts

  The beasts of old are nothing but legend.
  A few who travel into the deep forests and high mountains
  return with wild tales of monstrous creatures, but they are obviously delusional.

  <details>
    <summary>Quest Starter — Established in [Session 1](./session-001)</summary>

    <div>
      You were witness to an attack by what you thought was an animal of monstrous proportions.

      How can you prove your innocence? Can you even trust your own memories of the event?
    </div>
  </details>
</aside>

<aside class="paragraphs-container">
  ### Horrors

  Nothing but stories to frighten children.

  <details>
    <summary>Quest Starter</summary>

    <div>
      The murders began last season.
      Local gossip suggests they are the work of a vengeful horror...
