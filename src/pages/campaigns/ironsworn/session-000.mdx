## Our Setting

<aside class="paragraphs-container">
  ### The Havens

  An expansive region of forests, rivers, shrubland, and low hills.

  <details>
    <summary>Quest Starter</summary>

    <div>
      A settlement has fallen under the unjust rule of a cruel leader.
      What leverage do they hold over these people? What is your connection to the
      community? What can be done to overthrow this tyrant?
    </div>
  </details>

## Our Truths

<aside class="paragraphs-container">
  ### The Old World

  The savage clans called the Skulde invaded the kingdoms of the Old
  World. Our armies fell. Most were killed or taken into slavery. Those
  who escaped set sail aboard anything that would float. After an arduous
  months-long voyage, the survivors made landfall upon the Ironlands.

  <details>
    <summary>Quest Starter</summary>

    <div>
      You are a descendant of the Skulde. Because of your heritage,
      your family has long borne the distrust of your fellow Ironlanders. Now, a
      small force of Skulde have landed on our shores. Are they the harbinger of
      an invasion? Where do your loyalties lie?
    </div>
  </details>
</aside>

<aside class="paragraphs-container">
  ### Iron

  The weather is bleak. Rain and wind sweep in from the ocean. The winters
  are long and bitter. One of the first settlers complained, “Only those made
  of iron dare live in this foul place”—and thus our land was named.

  <details>
    <summary>Quest Starter</summary>

    <div>
      The harvest fell short. The unrelenting snows left the village
      isolated. The food is running out. What will you do to see these people
      through this harsh season?
    </div>
  </details>
</aside>

<aside class="paragraphs-container">
  ### Legacies

  Other humans sailed here from the Old World untold years ago, but all
  that is left of them is a savage, feral people we call the broken. Is their fate
  to become our own?

   <details>
    <summary>Quest Starter</summary>

    <div>
      You find a child—one of the broken. It is wounded, and
      hunted by others of its kind. Do you protect it, even at the risk of inviting
      the wrath of the broken tribes?
    </div>
  </details>
</aside>

<aside class="paragraphs-container">
  ### Communities

  We live in communities called circles. These are settlements ranging in
  size from a steading with a few families to a village of several hundred.
  Some circles belong to nomadic folk. Some powerful circles might
  include a cluster of settlements. We trade (and sometimes feud) with other circles.

   <details>
    <summary>Quest Starter</summary>

    <div>
      A decades-long feud between two circles has flared into open
      conflict. What is the cause of this dispute? Do you join in the fight, or swear
      to put a stop to it?
    </div>
  </details>
</aside>

<aside class="paragraphs-container">
  ### Leaders

  Leadership is as varied as the people.

   <details>
    <summary>Quest Starter — Established in [Session 1](./session-001)</summary>

    <div>
      You have vivid reoccurring dreams of an Ironlands city.
      It has strong stone walls, bustling markets, and a keep on a high hill.
      Somehow, no matter how long it takes, you must make this vision a reality.
    </div>
  </details>
</aside>

<aside class="paragraphs-container">
  ### Defense

  The wardens are our soldiers, guards, and militia. They serve their
  communities by standing sentry, patrolling surrounding lands, and
  organizing defenses in times of crisis. Most have strong ties to their
  community. Others, called free wardens, are wandering mercenaries who
  hire on to serve a community or protect caravans.

   <details>
    <summary>Quest Starter</summary>

    <div>
      You come upon a dying warden. She tells you of an important
      mission, and charges you with its completion. “Swear to me,” she says,
      reaching out with a bloodied hand to give you an object crucial to the quest.
      What is it?
    </div>
  </details>
</aside>

<aside class="paragraphs-container">
  ### Mysticism

  Magic is rare and dangerous, but those few who wield the power are truly gifted.

   <details>
    <summary>Quest Starter</summary>

    <div>
      You have heard stories of someone who wields true power.
      They live in an isolated settlement far away. Who told you of this mystic?
      Are they feared or respected? Why do you swear to seek them out?
    </div>
  </details>
</aside>

<aside class="paragraphs-container">
  ### Religion

  A few Ironlanders still make signs or mumble prayers out of habit or
  tradition, but most believe the gods long ago abandoned us.

   <details>
    <summary>Quest Starter</summary>

    <div>
      A charismatic Ironlander, encouraging her followers to
      renounce the vestiges of Old World religions, proposes a new path for this
      new world. What doctrine does she teach? What does she seek to achieve?
      Are you sworn to aid or stop her?
    </div>
  </details>
</aside>

<aside class="paragraphs-container">
  ### Firstborn

  The firstborn have passed into legend. Some say the remnants of the old
  tribes still dwell in deep forests or high mountains. Most believe they
  were never anything more than myth.

   <details>
    <summary>Quest Starter</summary>

    <div>
      Someone obsessed with the firstborn wants to find evidence
      of their existence. This will require an expedition into the far reaches of the
      Ironlands. What is your role in this mission?
    </div>
  </details>
</aside>

<aside class="paragraphs-container">
  ### Beasts

  The beasts of old are nothing but legend. A few who travel into the deep
  forests and high mountains return with wild tales of monstrous creatures,
  but they are obviously delusional. No such things exist.

  <details>
    <summary>Quest Starter</summary>

    <div>
      You were witness to an attack by what you thought was an
      animal of monstrous proportions. No one believes you. In fact, you are
      accused of the murder you blame on this beast. How can you prove your
      innocence? Can you even trust your own memories of the event?
    </div>
  </details>
</aside>

<aside class="paragraphs-container">
  ### Horrors

  Nothing but stories to frighten children.

  <details>
    <summary>Quest Starter</summary>

    <div>
      The murders began last season. Local gossip suggests they
      are the work of a vengeful horror, but there may be more mundane forces at
      work. What is your connection to these killings? What will you do to stop them?
    </div>
