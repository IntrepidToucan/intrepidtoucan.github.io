    <h2>Principles</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Maintain your alignment, then disrupt your opponent's alignment</li>
      <li>Exert continuous strategic pressure against your opponent</li>
      <li>Control your center of gravity and momentum</li>
      <li>Continually off-balance your opponent (kuzushi)</li>
      <li>Take a dominant angle</li>
      <li>Attain inside channel control</li>
      <li>Use every part of all your limbs</li>
      <li>Use your head to frame, post, and wedge</li>
      <li>Your spine can be a powerful frame</li>
      <li>Maintain knee-elbow connection</li>
      <li>Address the leading edge</li>
      <li>Meet or redirect your opponent’s force vector</li>
      <li>Turn your opponent’s frames into levers</li>
      <li>Use overwhelming force when attacking levers</li>
      <li>
        Maximize control using lever-based control and far-side limb control
        (rotational control)
      </li>
      <li>
        Maximize strength using ratchet levers and internal/external rotation
      </li>
      <li>Focus your force into a small, hard surface area</li>
      <li>Advance position using placeholders</li>
      <li>
        Stay on your side for stronger lateral movement (your body is stronger
        on the sagittal plane)
      </li>
    </ul>

                Grip as close to a lever point (a joint or the end of the lever)

              </li>
              <li>
                To maximize control, roll and rotate (do both when possible) the
                gripped material and remove slack (e.g., when gripping a sleeve,
                roll your hand to your knuckles and frame it against your

              </li>

                Rolling and rotating the material forces your opponent to break
                alignment (due to needing to address multiple directions) when

                Generally, same-side collar grip is superior to cross-collar

                Useful for pulling your opponent across (using a rowing motion

                rotational control and offensive potential than the same-side

                Cuff grip: roll the sleeve into your fingers and twist outward,

                    Faster to attain than the pistol grip and more popular in

                Pistol grip: hook the sleeve with your index finger, then gather
                a fistful of material, removing as much slack as possible and
                leaving your thumb out for safety—twist your fist to block your
                opponent’s arm with your ulnar bone (make your wrists
                perpendicular)

                <ul>

              <li>
                Useful for controlling your opponent’s arm in general (prevent

                end-of-lever control
              </li>
              <li>
                Limited control when used by itself—better when combined with a
                hinge on your opponent (e.g., foot on their hip, foot on their
                bicep)

                Useful for pulling your opponent’s arm across their body and
                exposing their back—if using a cuff grip, you can allow for more
                initial slack in the material so you can rotate the grip to the
                other side of your opponent’s wrist and then pull their arm
                across
              </li>
              <li>
                Can be useful for defense through pushing your opponent’s arm
                away from their body, but you must turn and maintain
                hip-shoulder alignment (don’t just pass your arm over your

                  In general, you want to clear grips, close the distance, and
                  stay close to pass guard. This is generally easier to do in a
                  gi. No-gi tends to use a tighter style of guard passing (body
                  locks, underhooks) to maintain connection.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Guard pass categories: around the legs, through the legs,
                  under the legs
                </li>
                <li>
                  Think of passing techniques as methods of transition between
                  staging positions (positions of advantage that provide
                  stability)—when your path seems blocked, you may see openings
                  toward other staging positions
                </li>
              </ul>

              Guard passing heuristics:
              <ul>
                <li>Make your opponent face away from you</li>
                <li>Bring one side of your opponent’s hips to the mat</li>
                <li>
                  Maneuver around your opponent’s frames (attack them at angles
                  rather than straight on)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Lift your weight slightly off a frame to make it easier to
                  clear
                </li>
                <li>
                  Maintain knee-elbow connection to protect against attacks
                </li>
                <li>Separate your opponent’s knees from their chest</li>
                <li>
                  Stay on top (don’t just stay down if your opponent is in the
                  process of sweeping you)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Work through the layers of the guard (feet → knees/shins →
                  hips → arms), beating each one with your shoulders, knees, and
                  hips
                </li>
                <li>
                  When transitioning to a different staging position, stay on
                  the same guard layer or advance to a further layer
                </li>
                <li>
                  Avoid leg entanglements (keep your feet out of range, strip
                  grips on your leg, tripod and wedge against your opponent’s
                  body with your head, drop your leg to the ground, etc.)
                </li>
                <li>
                  “2 steps forward, 1 step back”: transition to a different
                  staging position if you’re about to lose your position
                </li>
                <li>
                  Stay on the balls of your feet so you can move faster and
                  drive into your opponent
                </li>
                <li>Keep your opponent’s feet off your torso</li>
                <li>
                  Get the far-side underhook (keeps you close to your opponent,
                  makes it difficult for them to frame, and keeps you from being
                  bumped forward), but don’t reach for it if you haven’t dealt
                  with at least one of your opponent’s legs (risk of getting
                  pulled into closed guard)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Don’t let your opponent underhook you (under the arm, around
                  the waist, or under the leg)--block their arm and underhook
                  them
                </li>
                <li>Get the crossface</li>
                <li>
                  Control your opponent’s hips (e.g., underhook their waist to
                  prevent hip escaping)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Fatigue your opponent (some positions are inherently tiring
                  for the bottom person—e.g., getting stacked)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Learn to pass while standing (you have better mobility than

                </li>
                <li>
                  Control your opponent’s bottom leg (makes it hard for them to
                  make space or stand up—they need to retract their bottom leg
                  to stand)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Control your opponent’s bottom arm (hard to stand up without
                  posting on your bottom arm)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Win the inside position (push the insides of your opponent’s
                  legs, as the adductors tend to be relatively weak); clear leg
                  frames from the inside before moving to the outside of your
                  opponent’s legs
                </li>
                <li>
                  Use windshield wipers to pass over limbs without making large
                  movements
                </li>
                <li>Use your head to wedge and post</li>
                <li>
                  Keep your legs just within reach (not close enough for your
                  opponent to get good grips but not too far that you have poor
                  mobility and leave your arms unsupported)—if your opponent
                  reaches for a grip, they’ll open up for you to get closer and
                  attain more control
                </li>
                <li>
                  Use posts to maintain base and active posts to redirect your
                  pressure as needed
                </li>
                <li>
                  In general, you want your elbows/knees tight and hands/feet
                  out wide when passing (tight for control, wide for posting)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Take your opponent out of their element (e.g., make them
                  switch from seated guard to recumbent guard and vice versa,
                  pass outside their legs if they try to put their legs inside
                  yours)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Catch your opponent between supine and seated (e.g., spin them
                  while they have only one point of contact with the floor,
                  close the distance as they sit up)
                </li>
              </ul>

              Guard passing postures:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Combat base - one leg leading plus knee-elbow connection,
                  other leg back for mobility (can be standing or kneeling)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Full squat - useful when your opponent has upper body control
                  of you in gi (squatting closes the space between your armpits
                  and legs)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Kneeling - prevents leg entanglements, can also be used in
                  half guard and closed guard; poor mobility and bad for offense
                </li>
                <li>
                  Tripod - useful for pressuring your opponent’s torso while
                  walking your feet up above their knees (e.g., when they have a
                  knee shield); can also block your opponent’s knee from their
                  chest and collapse frames
                </li>
                <li>
                  Tall posture - useful for pressuring an opponent’s collar grip
                </li>
                <li>
                  Gorilla posture - useful for moving around the legs when
                  passing; hips over feet (for mobility), shoulders forward of
                  or above hands (so you can push weight down)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Knee through (cross-knee or near-side) - one knee stapling
                  your opponent’s bottom leg, other leg stepped up, your weight
                  hovering over your opponent
                </li>
              </ul>

                  Generally favors taller people (harder for your opponent to
                  reach their feet to your biceps or get solid grips)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Toreando pass: Grip inside your opponent’s shins just below
                  the knee. Push their knees down, forward, and outward. Push
                  one knee up while moving laterally and pulling the other knee
                  across your body. As you pass their foot, punch the leg across
                  while pressuring with your other arm. Wedge the leg-punching
                  shoulder into their chest. Establishing side control, block
                  their hips with the other arm.

                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      The shin grip and outward pressure prevent your opponent
                      from pummeling their feet onto your biceps
                    </li>
                    <li>Stay close and keep your weight above your opponent</li>
