      This is a small, tucked-away corner of my website where I track my
      training progress in Brazilian jiu-jitsu.
    </p>

    <h2>Principles</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Maintain your alignment, then disrupt your opponent's alignment</li>
      <li>Exert continuous strategic pressure against your opponent</li>
      <li>Control your center of gravity and momentum</li>
      <li>Continually off-balance your opponent (kuzushi)</li>
      <li>Use every part of all your limbs</li>
      <li>Use your head to frame, post, and wedge</li>
      <li>Your spine can be a powerful frame</li>
      <li>Maintain knee-elbow connection</li>
      <li>Address the leading edge</li>
      <li>Meet or redirect your opponent’s force vector</li>
      <li>Turn your opponent’s frames into levers</li>
      <li>Use overwhelming force when attacking levers</li>
      <li>Focus your force into a small, hard surface area</li>
      <li>
        Maximize strength using lever-based control, ratchet levers, and
        internal/external rotation
      </li>
      <li>Take a dominant angle</li>
      <li>Advance position using placeholders</li>
    </ul>
